# Housing-Price-Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end project where I analyzed a housing dataset and built a Linear Regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on various features.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Understand the relationship between various housing features and house prices.
- Build a predictive model for estimating house prices using Linear Regression.
- Demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about houses, including features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and more. [Include the source of the dataset or upload the dataset if permissible.]

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Performed initial inspection of the data to understand its structure and contents.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by imputing or removing them.
- Encoded categorical variables to numerical values.
- Standardized/normalized numerical features for better model performance.

### 3. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained a Linear Regression model using the training data.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Results
- Achieved a [mention R-squared value or other key metrics] on the test dataset.
- [Add any specific insights gained from the data or the model.]

## Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
